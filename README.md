# ktOSINT
A custom implementation of OSINT frameworks in Kotlin

## Installation, dependencies, etc.
Unfortunately, it is incredibly difficult to create and publish Kotlin packages due to issues with Gradle and Maven and other things that I couldn't figure out. For the moment, the only way to install it is by creating and adding the files and dependencies yourself. The files are all in `src/main/` and the dependencies are commented in `build.gradle.kts`.
